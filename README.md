### Hi there 👋

- I'm currently working on a few things that aren't public just yet 👀
- I create interactive visualizations & maps! 📈🗺️ Find an overview on [my website](https://sarahschoettler.com/#projects). 
- I teach workshops and short courses for the Centre for Data, Culture & Society at the University of Edinburgh; all our teaching materials are public via the [DCS-training org](https://github.com/DCS-training/).
- Check out my [survey of geospatial network visualization techniques](https://geonetworks.github.io/)! If you also have a survey or other collection you want to publish, I created the [filterable-collection](https://github.com/sarah37/filterable-collection) website template based on the survey website.
- I also made a little tool to [strip extra markup out of automated Zoom transcripts](https://sarah37.github.io/clean-zoom-transcript/)
